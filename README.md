## About The Project

Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Originally a Paper-and-pencil game, there are now electronic versions.

In this implementation of the game, computer chooses a random word. If player is able to guess the word within allowed trie, he wins the game.
